# Skill Publish

Audit, clean, and publish agent skills to ClawHub and GitHub. Works with any SKILL.md-based skill in the OpenClaw ecosystem.

Complements `skill-design-guide` (design-time) with publish-time workflow.

**Version**: v1.0.2 (2026-07-15)

> ⚠️ **Publish has external side effects.** `audit` mode is read-only. `publish` mode
> transmits the cleaned skill contents to ClawHub and GitHub (public services) and may
> delete files in the remote GitHub repo. It never modifies your local files, and it only
> runs after an audit and your explicit confirmation of the file list, target repos, and
> version. Treat everything you publish as publicly visible.

## Modes

| Mode | Command | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Audit** | "audit skill" | Read-only scan — reports issues, changes nothing, transmits nothing |
| **Publish** | "publish skill" | After audit + confirmation: clean (in a temp copy) → push to ClawHub/GitHub → verify |

## What It Checks

1. **Personal data** — share counts, cost basis, account values, personal names
2. **Frontmatter** — description length, language, version numbers in name
3. **Content** — internal dev notes, references sections, version history
4. **Language** — English SKILL.md body, bilingual READMEs
5. **Files** — ticker-specific scripts, meta-documents, outdated files

## Quick Start

```bash
# Audit a skill directory
"audit skill ~/.workbuddy/skills/my-skill"

# Publish to ClawHub + GitHub
"publish skill ~/.workbuddy/skills/my-skill@1.2.0"
```
